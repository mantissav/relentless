To install the pack all you have to do is remove anything that is currently in your .minecraft/mods and .minecraft/config folder; 
you can also just put the contents of these folders somewhere else if you want.

After that just put the scripts, config, and mods folder in this zip file into your .minecraft folder. 
(You dont actually need the config and scripts folders, put them in if you think you will ever want to player singleplayer, otherwise the sever takes care of it)

The reason you have to put the config in manually is because I had to change stuff in the config to prevent mods from overriding each other,
one mod said dimension -2 was "The Drop" and the other mod said it was a spaceship and telling everyone to change it would be annoying, so
I decided to configure it myself and include it in this zip.
